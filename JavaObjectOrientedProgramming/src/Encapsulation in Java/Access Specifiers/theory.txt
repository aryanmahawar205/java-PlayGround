There are 4 types of access modifiers/specifiers in Java
- public
- private
- protected
- default

public - stuff can be accessed by anyone in the class and also anyone in another package
can also access it

private - here stuff is only accessible within the class, anything outside the class
cannot access it

protected - all stuff within the same package can access it, but in any other
package, only the subclasses can access it

default - you don't really have to specify it, since it already exists
here all stuff within the same package can access it, but any other package cannot
