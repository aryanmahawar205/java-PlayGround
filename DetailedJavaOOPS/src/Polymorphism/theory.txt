Types of Polymorphism:

1. Compile time / Static polymorphism:
--- achieved via function/method overloading
--- function/method overloading essentially means having same name
--- but arguments, return types and ordering of argument types can be different
--- ex. having multiple constructors

2. Run time / Dynamic polymorphism:
--- achieved via function/method overriding
--- basically in overriding, everything is same for a
--- particular method or function, except for its body/implementation
